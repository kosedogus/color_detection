Color detection using webcam.

To change the color simply change the "**blue = [255,0,0]**" to any other value.

It's in BGR(Blue,Green,Red) format.

If you have more than one webcam you might want to change the **VideCapture**'s index (in default it's 0).

To change the color "range" use "**lower**" and "**upper**" variables inside utils.py
